# AXI4-Lite-Slave-Interface

# AXI4-Lite Slave Interface (Verilog/SystemVerilog)

## üìò Project Overview

This project implements a simple AXI4-Lite Slave Interface in SystemVerilog, useful for beginners and intermediate learners who want to get hands-on experience with AMBA AXI4-Lite protocol, commonly used in SoC and FPGA design.

It simulates a basic memory-mapped register interface that supports read and write operations through AXI4-Lite transactions. This type of interface is widely used in industry for peripheral communication, making it highly relevant for placement in companies like Samsung Electronics, Intel, Qualcomm, etc.
